	<h2>Scenario Testing Report Template</h2>

<p>Scenario and Campaign testing, well, mostly scenario testing heh.
</p>

<p>When you test a scenario or scenarios in a campaign, you should have pre-set template of report questions to fill out so you cover all the aspects of the scenario.
</p>

<p>Briefing is it properly written, ie helpful?<br>
Briefing tactical map images included and ok?<br>
Designers notes, are they ok?<br>
Is the scenario laggy?<br>
Are there enough infantry for boots on the ground type stuff?<br>
Are there enough armored vehicles?<br>
Are there enough transport vehicles?<br>
Are there right amount, too few or too many units?<br>
Do your troops selection make sense (not like only infantry HQ's but grunt squads themselves missing)?<br>
Are blue/red force levels ok?<br>
Is the terrain nice / suitable?<br>
Is AI plans working ok (no repeating single objective approaches etc)?<br>
Are victory conditions working?<br>
Does the scenario end?<br>
Is the scenario "cool"?<br>
Was the scenario difficult?<br>
Time to complete (turns/minutes)?
